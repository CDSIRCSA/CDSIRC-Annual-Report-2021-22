                    <p>(1) The Child Death and Serious Injury Review Committee established under the Children’s Protection Act 1993 continues in existence.</p>
                    <i>Children and Young People (Oversight and Advocacy Bodies) Act 2016</i>

                    <h3>2.1. Legislation and purpose</h3>
                    <p>The Child Death and Serious Injury Review Committee operates under Part 4 of the <a href="https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/CHILDREN%20AND%20YOUNG%20PEOPLE%20(OVERSIGHT%20AND%20ADVOCACY%20BODIES)%20ACT%202016.aspx" target="_blank">Children and Young People (Oversight and Advocacy Bodies) Act 2016</a>.</p>
                    <p>The role of the Committee is to contribute to the prevention of death or serious injury of children and young people in South Australia.</p>
                    <p>The Committee reviews the circumstances and causes of death or serious injury to children and young people, and makes recommendations regarding changes to legislation, policies, procedures or practices of government and non-government agencies.</p>

                    <h3>2.2. The Committee's Strategic Action Plan 2021–22</h3>
                    <p>The Committee developed a Strategic Action Plan with three priorities that guide and direct its work.</p>
                    <div id="2.2.1">
                        <h4>2.2.1. Understanding ourselves</h4>
                        <p><strong><i>The Committee will maintain its effectiveness by defining roles, responsibilities and expectations of all members.</i></strong></p>
                        <p>The Committee met on eleven occasions in 2021–22. At each meeting the Committee considered 6-10 child deaths, including the circumstances of the death, the cause of the death, and if relevant the family’s history of contact with the child protection system, with a view to identifying potential systemic issues that require further review by one of the Committee’s Special Interest Groups.</p>
                        <p>In addition to attendance at these meetings, each member contributed their knowledge and expertise to regular meetings of one or more Special Interest Groups, including child protection, health, disability, suicide prevention, culturally and linguistically diverse families, child safety, and Aboriginal children and young people. In-depth reviews were undertaken by teams drawn from the Committee’s membership. The members met as required to plan and complete each review. The average number of out-of-session meetings of Committee members was two per month.</p>

                        <p><strong><i>The Committee strives for continuous improvement of its knowledge and understanding of issues that impact children, young people and their families.</i></strong></p>
                        <p>The Committee and its Special Interest Groups improved their knowledge of service provision issues that might impact children and young people through discussions with representatives from agencies providing services to children and young people, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Post-care Services Design Project – Commissioning, Performance and Disability Directorate of the Department for Child Protection</li>
                            <li>Child and Family Support System – Department of Human Services</li>
                            <li>‘One in Four’ reform program to support children and young people with functional needs in schools and preschools – Early Years and Child Development Division of the Department for Education</li>
                            <li>structural and strategic reforms – Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Establishment of the Oversight and Advocacy Authority for Aboriginal Children and Young People – CDSIRC</h5>
                        <p>A co-design process with eight nominated Aboriginal thinkers and leaders has resulted in the drafting of a vision statement and Terms of Reference for the Oversight and Advocacy Authority for Aboriginal Children and Young People – CDSIRC. With Ministerial approval, appointments will be made as advisors to the Committee. Once established, this group will use Aboriginal cultural knowledge to guide and direct the review of Aboriginal child deaths in culturally appropriate ways.</p>
                    </div><br>

                    <div id="2.2.2">
                        <h4>2.2.2. Building strategic alliances</h4>
                        <p><strong><i>Through active engagement with service systems and strategic allies the Committee will seek to influence outcomes for children, young people and their families.</i></strong></p>
                        <h5>Ministerial engagement</h5>
                        <p>Through regular meetings with the Chair and members, the Committee has maintained contact with the former Minister for Education and the current Minister for Education, Training and Skills. These meetings ensure that the Minister is apprised of the focus of the Committee’s current and future work and the ways in which it is seeking to engage and influence service provision to children and young people.</p>
                        <h5>Oversight and Advocacy Bodies</h5>
                        <p>The Committee has been an active participant in three-monthly meetings of the five agencies established under the Children and Young People (Oversight and Advocacy Bodies) Act 2016: the Commissioner for Children and Young People, the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, the Guardian for Children and Young People and Training Centre Visitor, and the Child Development Council. These meetings provide the opportunity for each agency to share information and knowledge about the ways in which they are seeking to improve outcomes for children and young people.</p>
                        <h5>Sudden unexpected infant deaths</h5>
                        <p>Continuing its commitment to preventing the sudden unexpected deaths of infants, the Committee has supported the revision of the South Australian safe infant sleeping guidelines and standards. As part of the guidelines review working group, the Committee provided up-to-date data about the number and rates of sudden unexpected infant deaths in South Australia and provided feedback about the draft guidelines.</p>
                        <p>The guidelines and standards are critical to a state-wide, consistent and effective approach to the transmission of information to families about the best ways in which to safely sleep their infant.</p>
                        <p>On request from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Committee has provided aggregated data to inform the ACCC’s nation-wide consultation about proposed policy options to reduce the risk of injury and death associated with infant sleep products, including inclined sleep products, and household and folding cots.</p>
                        <h5>Child restraints and transport-related deaths</h5>
                        <p>Based on its analyses of the role of child restraints in transport-related deaths and of driveway runover deaths, the Committee provided a submission to the Department for Infrastructure and Transport in relation to <i>South Australia’s Road Safety Strategy to 2031</i> (the Strategy). In its submission, the Committee questioned the reliability of the current age-based system governing the use of child restraints, which potentially leads to children being prematurely transitioned out of size-appropriate child seats.</p>
                        <p>The Committee also expressed concern about the lack of recognition of ‘driveway runovers’ in the Strategy. These deaths usually occur on private property and are not included in road transport crash statistics, but are nevertheless transport-related deaths that can likely be reduced by improved road safety strategies.</p>
                        <p>In conjunction with Kidsafe SA, one of the Committee’s key prevention partners, letters were sent to the Chief Executives of six public and private birthing hospitals in South Australia. The letter highlighted the need to ensure that all new parents receive child restraint information before and after the birth of their infant and recommended that each hospital embed information about Kidsafe’s child restraint advice and support services into hospital discharge protocols.</p>

                    <div id="2.2.3">
                        <h4>2.2.3. Making data real and useful</h4>
                        <p><strong><i>The Committee is committed to using its data to build a better understanding of the contribution child death review can make to the safety and wellbeing of children.</i></strong></p>
                        <p>In 2021–2022, the Committee’s secretariat developed and implemented a new database and reporting system. This new system has features which will allow the Committee to work more effectively and efficiently, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>flexible design to meet the Committee’s changing needs and data collections</li>
                            <li>data validation and data quality controls</li>
                            <li>automated data entry and data processing</li>
                            <li>highly secure data storage.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Five-year data summary</h5>
                        <p>In May 2022, the Committee published a five-year data summary on its website<sup><a href="https://cdsirc.sa.gov.au/five-year-data-summary/" target="_blank">7</a></sup>. This analysis includes interactive figures and provides a contemporary summary of child deaths in South Australia, including the principal factors known to be associated with the risk of child death and with discrepancies in rates of child death between different parts of the population. This format takes important analyses that would previously be spread throughout an annual report and presents them together in a more digestible and accessible way. These data will be updated on a yearly basis.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Trends in neonatal deaths</h5>
                        <p>The Committee published a follow-up analysis<sup>8</sup> of its previous blog discussing an interesting trend in fewer neonatal deaths, particularly those associated with gestation, fetal growth, and complications of pregnancy. This phenomenon will be re-examined in 2023 and the Committee will share its findings on its website and in an upcoming data report.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Child deaths in families with a culturally or linguistically diverse background</h5>
                        <p>Research suggests families with a culturally or linguistically diverse (CALD) background may experience multiple health conditions and barriers to accessing health care<sup>9</sup>, which increase the risk of poor outcomes including death. The Committee has sought to better understand the experience of refugees and the impact of migration on the deaths of children by linking its register of child deaths with Births, Deaths and Marriages. The country of birth of both the deceased child and their parents has been linked with information about the death of the child. A first analysis of the impact of cultural and linguistic diversity will be available in 2023.</p>
                        <p>The Committee has also undertaken brief reviews of the deaths of several children with a CALD family background to explore the influence their background had on the circumstances of their death. This will form the basis for future in-depth reviews of child deaths in families with a CALD background.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Work towards the Australian Child Death Data Collection</h5>
                        <p>The Australian and New Zealand Child Death Review and Prevention Group (ANZCDRPG) aims to identify, address and reduce the number of infant, child and youth deaths by sharing information on issues in the review and reporting of child deaths, and to work collaboratively towards national and international reporting. In 2022, South Australia led discussions with ANZCDRPG about models of national data collection. ANZCDRPG agreed to establish a national data collection on child deaths at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). Work continues in collaboration with the AIHW and the Queensland Family and Child Commission, the current convening jurisdiction for the ANZCDRPG.</p>

                        <h5>Providing data to requesting jurisdictions</h5>
                        <p>On request from the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Victorian child death review teams, the Committee has provided de-identified information about the deaths of children in South Australia who were normally resident in another state. Sharing information between jurisdictions is an important way to foster collaboration between child death teams nationally.</p>
