                    <h3>1.1. Monitoring and reviewing child deaths</h3>
                    <p>The intent of the Committee is to improve the safety and wellbeing of children and young people in South Australia. It does this by collecting information about the circumstances and causes of all child deaths in South Australia, analysing and reviewing this information, making recommendations to relevant agencies, and monitoring the implementation of those recommendations. The Committee reviews specific cases of child death, and from time to time also reviews and analyses information about serious injuries.</p>

                    <p>Opportunities for prevention and intervention to improve the safety and wellbeing of children and young people can be identified through the systematic collection and analysis of information about child deaths. Section 37 of the <a href="https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/CHILDREN%20AND%20YOUNG%20PEOPLE%20(OVERSIGHT%20AND%20ADVOCACY%20BODIES)%20ACT%202016.aspx" target="_blank">Children and Young People (Oversight and Advocacy Bodies) Act 2016<sup>1</a></sup> identifies those deaths as eligible for review if: (a) the incident resulting in the child’s death or serious injury occurred in the state; or (b) the child was, at the time of the death or serious injury, ordinarily resident in the State.</p>
                    <p>As required by the Act, the Committee maintains a database of child deaths and serious injuries, to which it continually adds information that informs its analyses about rates and patterns of child death in South Australia.</p>

                    <p>The Committee observed the lowest number of child deaths on record consecutively in 2019 (81 deaths) and 2020 (73 deaths). However, in 2021, 104 children and young people died in South Australia. This increase was seen particularly in males, a pattern that has also been observed in previous years.</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing, information on causes of death for about one quarter of the 2021 deaths was not available due to COVID-19-related delays in systems from which the Committee collects information. Consequently, it is not yet possible to identify potential causes of the increase in deaths in 2021. The Committee will publish a detailed statistical report in 2023, when this information is available.</p>

                            The highest <i>rate</i> of death for children and young people is associated with living in the Far North region of the state. In contrast, the greatest <i>number</i> of deaths is recorded in the Northern Adelaide region. Services should be planned and delivered to take into account regions where the rate of death is highest, and regions where the greatest number of deaths occur.

                        <p>During the period 2005 to 2021, Aboriginal children and young people constituted 4.5% of the South Australian population of children and young people, but they accounted for 12% of child deaths. The rate of death for all Aboriginal children and young people who died in South Australia was 81 deaths per 100,000 (Figure 5). For Aboriginal children and young people who were usually resident in South Australia, the death rate was 66 deaths per 100,000 over the same period. This difference in rates reflects the number of children and young people with complex medical conditions who were retrieved from other states or territories for treatment in South Australian hospitals. The rate of death for non-Aboriginal children and young people was 28 deaths per 100,000 (Figure 5). The rate of death for non-Aboriginal children and young people usually resident in South Australia was 27 deaths per 100,000<sup>5</sup>.</p>

                        <h4>1.3.1. Neglect of critical medical care</h4>
                        <p>‘Medical neglect occurs when children are harmed or placed at significant risk of harm by gaps in their medical care. This is most likely to occur and to be recognised when families lack capability, commonly due to poverty, and when medical demands are high, such as with complex, severe, and chronic illness’<sup>6</sup>. These illnesses, which are often life-limiting without treatment, typically require management by multiple sub-speciality medical units. When critical medical care is neglected, effective medical treatment must be provided promptly to prevent death.</p>
                        <p>Only a small number of children and young people each year experience neglect of their critical medical care. The Committee reviewed the deaths of four young people who died between 2018–2020 as a result of a serious disease and where neglect of critical medical care was identified in the circumstances of their deaths. Commonalities in the circumstances of their deaths included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>challenges for sub-specialist medical systems in communicating the dangers of neglect of critical medical care and seeking assistance with child protection matters</li>
                            <li>challenges for child protection systems in providing an effective response because of the medical complexity</li>
                            <li>the unreasonable expectation that the young person could self-manage a complex and serious disease</li>
                            <li>living in chaotic and/or neglectful situations or experiencing homelessness</li>
                            <li>a history of concurrent mental health concerns in either the child, the family or both</li>
                            <li>chronic absenteeism from school</li>
                            <li>often a pattern of either more frequent hospital admission or presentation to the emergency department, or consistent non-attendance to medical appointments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a first step, the Committee drew the circumstances of death of children and young people experiencing neglect of their critical medical care to the attention of the Child Protection Reform Portfolio Management Board. At this meeting, the development of effective across-agency responses to neglect of critical medical care was discussed, including pathways to family support and broader access by medical staff to child protection expertise.</p>

                        <p>Squalor is a red flag for chronic neglect and cumulative harm, including serious injury and death. Children and young people should not be left to live in squalid conditions.</p>
                        <p>In a review of 13 child deaths, the Committee found that families living in squalor had contact with many different service systems including health, housing, child protection, education and police. These multiple contact points exemplify the complexities experienced by these children, young people and their families and highlight their need for co-ordinated and collaborative service approaches to assess and respond to the risk factors contributing to squalid living conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Committee raised these issues at a meeting convened by the Minister for Education, Training and Skills and attended by the ministers for Health and Wellbeing; Police, Emergency Services and Correctional Services; Child Protection; and Human Services. Discussed at the meeting were the roles each agency should play in addressing squalor and its impact on children and young people.</p>
                        <p>The Committee understands that this issue will be the subject of further discussion and action within these agencies.</p>

                        <p>The Committee reviewed the death of an infant where complex, intergenerational issues were prevalent in the family circumstances. In this review, failure to recognise the signs of intergenerational transmission of trauma and the effect it has on parenting capacity – which may include ‘failure to engage’ and avoidance of services – resulted in case closure by key agencies, leaving the children in this family at greater risk of harm.</p>
                        <p>Based on this review, the Committee concluded that to prevent death in similar circumstances, agencies must be committed to collaborative effort that recognises the impact of trauma, the dangers of squalor, and offers services that build engagement, are co-ordinated, responsive, persistent, reliable, person-specific, long-term and child-centred.</p>

                        <h4>1.3.4. Preventing deaths from asthma</h4>
                        <p>In 2018, the Committee undertook a review of 14 deaths due to asthma to highlight areas for improvement in asthma management and prevention.</p>
                        <p>The Committee found that health services can improve the quality of their care to children and young people with asthma by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>monitoring the medical follow-up by a paediatric respiratory specialist of all children and young people discharged from high dependency or intensive care units</li>
                            <li>monitoring the medical follow-up by a primary medical practitioner (general practitioner, paediatrician or paediatric respiratory specialist) of children and young people within 2–4 weeks of admission to hospital or presentation at an emergency department</li>
                            <li>assertive follow-up of children and young people from vulnerable families who were admitted to hospital or presented to an emergency department with asthma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health services can assist children and young people to get the care they need by ensuring all children with poorly controlled, severe or unstable asthma are under the long-term care of a paediatric respiratory specialist. This may include the use of telehealth services in rural settings.</p>
                        <p>The SA Health Child and Adolescent Health Community of Practice (CAHCoP) has recommended the development of regional Paediatric Asthma Hubs. In 2022, CAHCoP held discussions with the SA Health Rural Support Service to ascertain the level of service needs for paediatric respiratory care and to propose that a co-designed service be established. Discussions about how to progress a partnerships-based care network and develop and deliver the model of care are ongoing.</p>

                        <h4>1.3.5. The health and wellbeing of international students</h4>
                        <p>Young international students face many challenges when they come to live and study in South Australia.</p>
                        <p>International students under 18 years old are legally children in South Australia and are entitled to the legislated protections that recognise all children and young people should be protected from harm.</p>
                        <p>The Committee has recommended changes to standards for providers of education and training to international students to ensure these standards are specific enough to protect and promote the health and wellbeing of these students.</p>
                        <p>The Committee’s recommendations have been provided to the state government for consideration.</p>

                        <h4>1.3.6. Informal placement of Aboriginal children and young people</h4>
                        <p>There are many reasons why some Aboriginal children and young people may be moved informally to the care of people outside their immediate families. The suitability of these arrangements varies. Through its reviews, the Committee is familiar with the conditions under which some of these children and young people have lived – and died – trying to care for themselves without the conditions or maturity to do so.</p>
                        <p>Alongside the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, the Committee has presented at several forums where it has raised the issue of how best to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and young people in informal care arrangements.  In the Committee’s view, these arrangements need some degree of oversight, and this might best be provided by non-government Aboriginal organisations situated within the communities where these children and young people are living.</p>

                        <h4>1.3.7. Manner and management of the deaths of children and young people</h4>
                        <p>In 2019, the Committee asked the following question: Was every child offered management of their death where there was the opportunity for palliation?</p>
                        <p>The Committee developed a categorisation methodology for manner and management of death. In the cohort of children and young people who died between 2018 and 2020, 65% of deaths were managed either in a planned palliative manner or by offering redirection of active care to palliation. For 35% of deaths there was no opportunity to palliate. Based on this analysis, the Committee concluded that every child and young people was offered management of their death where there was an opportunity to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Committee presented these findings to the Australian and New Zealand Child Death Review Prevention Group in May 2022 and has discussed the findings with SA Health services caring for children and young people who are seriously ill. It was noted that the Women’s and Children’s Health Network Paediatric Intensive Care Unit has no dedicated social work resource to assist families with support when their child is seriously ill or with bereavement after their child has died.</p>
