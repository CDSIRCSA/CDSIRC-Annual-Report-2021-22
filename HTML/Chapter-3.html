                        <p>The <i>Children and Young People (Oversight and Advocacy Bodies) Act 2016</i> articulates the role and functions of the Committee and empowers it to obtain information about a case of child death or serious injury from any person (whether or not the person is a state authority, or an officer or employee of a state authority). Using this power, the Committee receives information regarding the death of a child from a range of sources and uses this information in its determinations.</p>

                        <h4>3.1.2. Sources of information regarding population estimates for children and young people in South Australia</h4>
                        <p>The Committee acquires the publicly available number of children and young people resident across the dimensions of calendar year, single year of age, sex, cultural background, and postcode from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The ABS provides this information in its five-yearly Census of Population and Housing. The estimated resident population is also available on a yearly basis.</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of this report, the population of children and young people resident in South Australia by calendar year, single year of age, sex, cultural background, and postcode is interpolated as follows: the counts across single year of age, sex, cultural background and postcode are taken from the census, and assigned to the calendar years as three years before each census to two years after the census. The multiplier needed to get from the census to the estimated resident population for each year is found and then applied to each of the 418,608 cells in the matrix calendar year (17 levels), age (18 levels), sex (2 levels), cultural background (2 levels), and postcode (342 levels). The multiplier is found by dividing the estimated resident population by the census count and is performed separately for the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations. Note that when re-aggregated, the adjusted count is the same as the estimated resident population.</p>

                        <p>Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) is a product developed by the ABS that ranks areas in Australia according to relative socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. The indexes are based on information from the five-yearly census.</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of this report, the Committee used the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD). The postcode of the usual residence of each child or young person who died was matched to the appropriate SEIFA/IRSD level extracted from the census nearest their year of death. Deciles were collapsed into quintiles: on this scale, quintile 1 includes areas with the greatest relative socioeconomic disadvantage and quintile 5 includes areas with the lowest relative socioeconomic disadvantage.</p>

                        <h4>3.2.1. Operational definition of death</h4>
                        <p>The Committee receives information regarding the death of a child or young person in South Australia from three government sources: Births, Deaths and Marriages; the State Coroner’s Court; and the Pregnancy Outcome Unit. The count of deaths in this annual report includes all cases received from these sources with the following exceptions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>if the Committee understands from the information gathered that the case was a termination of pregnancy</li>
                            <li>if the Committee understands that the death occurred after the birth of an infant, prior to 20 weeks gestation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Where there is disagreement between the sources, the Committee reviews all of the available evidence to arrive at a conclusion.</p>

                    <div id="3.2.2">
                        <h4>3.2.2. Cultural background</h4>
                        <p>
                            To differentiate grouping, the ABS uses the categories of ‘Aboriginal’, ‘Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Not stated’ and ‘Non-Indigenous’. For the purpose of this report, the Committee collapses these categories into two groups: ‘Aboriginal = ‘Aboriginal’, ‘Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’; and ‘Other’ = ‘Not stated’ and ‘Non-Indigenous’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that the Committee’s determination of the cultural background of a deceased child or young person uses multiple administrative sources<sup>10</a></sup>.

                    <p>Section 39 of the Act outlines the reporting responsibilities of the Committee. It requires the Committee to report periodically to the Minister for Education, Training and Skills, and also to provide an annual report on the performance of its statutory functions for the preceding financial year. The Committee submits a report to the Minister for Education, Training and Skills at the conclusion of each in-depth review. The report contains the Committee’s recommendations about systemic or legislative issues that may contribute to the prevention of similar deaths or serious injuries.</p>
